# odin_recipes
Project 1 for The Odin Project

It is my goal, by the end of this project to have a deeper knowledge of
	html, vscode, git bash/wsl2 terminal, github, and project management and organization
in general.

	 After doing this project, I have basic knowledge of git commands,
the ability to use git to open programs such as vscode and google chrome,
emulating linux through windows with wsl2, and increasingly better file organization by
the day. This first project had me wanting to show myself something kinda cool about
my journey learning to code.
	The Odin Project has been an awesome learning tool and community.

I chose Beef Stroganoff, Strawberry Rhubarb Jam, and Macaroni Salad as my
3 recipes. The html was easier for me than the grammar going through it this first time,
which is pretty odd to me.
	
	Thank you to anyone who reads this.
